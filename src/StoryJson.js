        god but had to remain on earth as punishment for stealing a sacred cow in a past life. The
        child was named Devavratha, but to confuse you he is called Bhishma (one of firm vow).Pandu is a pretty nice guy and loves to hunt. One day he is out hunting and he kills a
        deer while it is in the middle of “love play.” Turns out this is no ordinary deer but a god
        who curses Pandu and says essentially that since you interrupted me, I’m going to mess
        with you. The curse states that if you have sex you’ll die. Pandu has no kids at this time,
        but he does have two wives: Kunthi and Madri. He decides that he can’t rule, so he and
        his wives hang out in the woods. What Queen Satyavathis had not told anyone that before she was married she had
        actually been born from a fish and had had an encounter with a sage and given birth to a
        son named Vyasa.`,

        Santanu asked her father if he could marry her, and he said yes, but only if Satyavathi’s
        children inherit, leaving poor Bhishma out in the cold. Bhishma was actually cool with
        this and said he would remain celibate so that he never had children. Thus, King Santanu
        and ferry woman Satyavathi married. They had two boys: one had no children and died
        in battle, and one (Vichitravirya) grew to adulthood and married two women (Ambika
        and Ambalika). But before either of his wives had children, Vichitravirya died and not
        long after that King Santanu also died. Thus, the only surviving member of the royal
        family was Bhishma who had taken a vow of celibacy and refused to break it.`,

        description3: ` So even though Vyasa isn’t exactly the heir, he can still kind of
        inherit. One day Kunthi (Pandu’s wife #1) calls out for the sun god. He actually appears and she
        is freaked out.
        Everyone agreed that Vyasa should sleep with Vichitravirya’s two wives and their
        children would inherit. Ambika gave birth to a boy named Dhritarashtra. He was a nice
        enough guy and should have became king, but he was born blind. Meanwhile,
        Vichitravirya’s other wife got with Vyasa and she gave birth to a boy named Pandu.
        Dhritarashtra, being blind, realizes he can’t really rule, so he gives his kingdom to his
        brother Pandu.`,

        Kannaki and Kovalan are a newly married couple, in love, and living in bliss. Over time, 
        Kovalan meets Matavi (Madhavi) – a courtesan. He falls for her, leaves Kannaki and moves in with 
        Matavi. He spends lavishly on her. Kannaki is heartbroken, but as the chaste woman, she waits

        There is a 
        singing competition.Kovalan sings a poem about a woman who hurt her lover. Matavi then sings
        a song about a man who betrayed his lover. Each interprets the song as a message to the other.
        Kovalan feels Matavi is unfaithful to him and leaves her. Kannaki is still waiting for him. 
        She takes him back.`,
        description3:`
        Kannaki (above) is the central character of the Cilappatikāram epic. Statues, reliefs and temple 
        iconography of Kannaki are found particularly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.       
        Kannagi and Kovalan leave the city and travel to Madurai the capital of the Pandya kingdom. Kovalan is penniless and destitute. He confesses his mistakes to Kannagi. She forgives him and tells him the pain his unfaithfulness gave her. Then she encourages her husband to rebuild their life together and gives him one of her jeweled anklets to sell to raise starting capital.[12] Kovalan sells it to a merchant, but the merchant falsely frames him as having stolen the anklet from the queen. The king arrests Kovalan and then executes him, without the due checks and processes of justice.[12][13] When Kovalan does not return home, Kannagi goes searching for him. She learns what has happened. She protests the injustice and then proves Kovalan's innocence by throwing in the court the other jeweled anklet of the pair. The king accepts his mistake. Kannagi curses the king and curses the people of Madurai, tearing off her breast and throwing it at the gathered public. The king dies. The society that had made her suffer, suffers in retribution as the city of Madurai is burnt to the ground because of her curse.[12][13] In the third section of the epic, gods and goddesses meet Kannagi at Cheranadu and she goes to heaven with god Indra. The King Cheran Chenkuttuvan and royal family of the Chera kingdom (Today Kerala) learns about her, resolves to build a temple with Kannagi as the featured goddess. They go to the Himalayas, bring a stone, carve her image, call her goddess Pattini, dedicate a temple, order daily prayers, and perform a royal sacrifice.`,

        description1: `Draupadi, Kunti, Sita, are the names we usually come across in the context of the epics. The strong women in the  epics of south India are less well known.
        Manimekalai , the sequel to the Shilapaddikaram written by Kulavanigam Chittalai Shattanar (also spelt Cattanar), tells the story of the beautiful young daughter of Kovalan and the dancer Madhavi. After Kovalan’s unjust death, the courtesan Madhavi became a Buddhist nun. Her daughter Manimekalai, despite her beauty, shunned the pleasures of the world, and sought truth, finally gaining ultimate knowledge.
        The story is set in the second century CE in the Tamil region.Manimekalai, Madhavi and Sutamati went to the great Buddhist teacher, Aravana Adigal. Manimekalai narrated to him all that had happened so far, and he told her more about the past lives of her mother and friend Sutamati. He also explained some points of Buddhism. The mass of people, he said could not be drawn to the noble Buddhist path, but a few may be influenced to follow it.

        The text is considered a Perumkappiyan (Sanskrit: Mahakavya) or great kavya of Tamil literature.
        After further adventures, Manimekalai reached the city of Vanji. Disguised as a man she debated with the teachers of various sects and religions. After discussions, she understood the major religions and philosophies prevalent at the time, and felt that none of them provided the right solution to life. `,
        description3:`
        The goddess then returned to the city of Puhar. She went to prince Udayakumara, and warned him to leave Manimekalai alone. Then, the goddess woke Sutamati, Manimekalai’s best friend, told her that Manimekalai would return in seven days, and asked her to go to Madhavi and tell her that the goddess Manimekala had arrived, and had stated that  Manimekalai was destined for a life of asceticism and renunciation. Aravana Adigal then began to teach her the truths of Buddhism. He explained to her how and why the first Buddha, who was already a being of light, incarnated on earth, and the need for  understanding the four truths regarding suffering, and the means of freeing oneself from suffering through freedom from desire and through detachment, and  by love towards all beings. Manimekalai became a follower of the Buddhist dharma, lived in a monastery, and continued to perform acts of charity.`,

        description1: `There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children.

        One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all seven to her and said:
        
        ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you all—skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’
        
        The kids said: ‘Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go away without any anxiety.’
        
        Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.
        
        It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:
        
        ‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you.’
        
        But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice.`,
        description2: `Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called:

        ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you.’
        
        But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried:
        
        ‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like you: you are the wolf!’
        
        
        Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.
        
        So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said:
        
        ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her.’
        
        `,
        description3: `The little kids cried:

        ‘First show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.’
        
        Then he put his paws in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should come in but the wolf!
        
        What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said:
        
        ‘Now go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s stomach with them while he is still asleep.’
        
        Then the seven kids dragged the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once stirred.`,

        The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more. In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and the good man soon became thriving and well off again.`,

        The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt, and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’`,
        description3: `The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to watch what the little elves would do.

        ‘Oh, my dear musician, how beautifully you play! I wish you’d teach me how it’s done.’

        ‘Now,’ said the Musician, ‘if you want to learn to fiddle, here’s your chance. Lay your front paws in this crack.’
        
        The Wolf did as he was told, and the Musician quickly seized a stone, and wedged both his fore paws so firmly into the crack that he was held there, a fast prisoner.
        
        ‘Wait there till I return,’ said the Fiddler, and he went on his way.
        
        The Fox came straight up to him and said:
        
        ‘My dear friend, how beautifully you play the fiddle; I would like to learn how you do it.’
        
        ‘Nothing easier,’ said the Musician, ‘if you’ll promise to do exactly as I tell you.’
        
        ‘Certainly,’ answered the Fox, ‘you have only to say the word.’
        
        ‘Well, then, follow me,’ replied the Fiddler.`,

Here the Musician halted, bent a stout hazel bough down to the ground from one side of the path, and put his foot on the end of it to keep it down. Then he bent a branch down from the other side and said:

        ‘Give me your left front paw, my little Fox, if you really wish to learn how it’s done.’
        
        The Fox did as he was told, and the Musician tied his front paw to the end of one of the branches.
        
        ‘Now, my friend,’ he said, ‘give me your right paw.’
        
        This he bound to the other branch, and having carefully seen that his knots were all secure, he stepped off the ends of the branches, and they sprang back, leaving the poor Fox suspended in mid-air.
        
        ‘Just you wait where you are till I return,’ said the Musician, and he went on his way again.
        
        Once more he said to himself:

        “There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, ‘Wolf!’ but you didn’t come,” he wailed.
        
        An old man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said, “Nobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!”`

        description1: `Once upon a time, Raman set out on a long journey. In those days, one had to walk through the jungle to get to another city. On the way, another traveler joined Raman. “This place is infested with thieves. I am afraid they will rob me. Can I travel with you?” the man asked Raman. Raman readily agreed.

        That night, the two of them stopped at some place to rest. Raman was tired and fell asleep soon. His companion was waiting for this moment. In fact, he was a thief who used to rob travelers. He got up and looked under Raman’s pillow without disturbing him. He found nothing. `,
        description2: `The next morning, the two resumed their journey. They halted for the night. Raman had a sound sleep. His companion searched Raman’s belongings, looking for money and valuables. Again, he was disappointed.

        The next day, the two travelers reached the holy city of Tirupati, and they had to part company. The companion confessed that he was a thief. “ I have never met with failure. But this time I failed. Now that we are parting company, please tell me where did you hide the money in the night?” pleaded the thief. “Unless I know your secret, I may not be able to sleep,” he confessed.`,
        description3: `Raman smiled, “I knew you were a thief the moment I saw you. I took care to hide money where you would never find it.”

        “But where? I looked for it everywhere,” cried out the thief.
        
        “Did you look for it under your pillow?” asked Raman.
        
        “I looked for it under your pillow and found nothing. Why should I look for your money under my pillow?” asked the bewildered thief.
        
        “Because I hid the money under your pillow,” said Raman, “I was confident it was the one place you would never look for my money.”`

        description1: `One morning, a farmer found that some animal had broken into his farm in the night and had eaten some of the sugar canes he was growing. He decided to keep a watch. In the middle of the night, he went to his farm to make sure no animal had invaded the farm.

        To his surprise, he saw a white elephant busy eating the sugar canes. He ran after the elephant shouting. The elephant tried to flee. The farmer caught it by its tail. To his horror, he found the elephant rising off the ground. The jumbo was flying!
        
        The frightened farmer held on the tail of the flying elephant. The elephant landed in a garden above the clouds. The farmer recalled his grandmother talking about heaven. “This must be heaven,” he thought. He was delighted to see beautiful trees laden with juicy fruits. He started eating the fruits. He put some fruits in his pocket.`,
        description2: `The farmer’s friends would not believe his tale. He offered them juicy mangoes that he had plucked from the heavenly trees. The fruits were so sweet that all his friends agreed that they tasted heavenly. They wanted to know when he was going to heaven again. The farmer said he was planning a visit that night. His friends begged him to take them with him. The farmer agreed. “Yes, let’s all go to heaven and celebrate there,” he said. The friends decided they would meet in the sugarcane farm at midnight.

        That night as the farmer and his friends waited in the farm, they saw the white elephant descending from the sky. They waited patiently till the elephant had its share of sugarcanes.`,
        description3: `As the elephant was ready to take off, the farmer ran and held its tail. As the elephant rose, one of the friends ran and caught hold of the farmer’s legs. As the elephant rose higher, another man ran and held on to the legs of the man holding the legs of the farmer. Thus, the human chain grew, as every man held on to the legs of the other above him.

        As the elephant flew the friends started talking. One of them wanted to know whether there were water melons in the heavenly garden. “Of course, there are water melons,” said the farmer. “They are so huge!” he said.
        
        “How big?” the friend asked.
        
        “This big,” said the farmer, demonstrating with his hands.
        
        As he opened his hands to show how big the heavenly water melons were, the farmer and his friends fell. Luckily, they fell into a stream on good old earth.`

        description1: `One day, a group of monkeys in a banana grove decided to fast. “Fasting once in fifteen days is good for our health,” said a wise old monkey. All monkeys nodded their heads.

        “Let’s fast tomorrow,” said their leader. All monkeys agreed.
        
        Soon, the day of fasting arrived. All the monkeys closed their eyes and said a prayer. A little monkey opened a corner of his eye.
        
        There on the trees were bananas! Ripe bananas!
        
        The little fellow licked his lips.
        
        “No eating today, Chotu. We are fasting,” said his mother giving him a stern look.
        
        `,
        description2: `“I was wondering…” said Chotu.

        “What were you thinking of?” asked the mother impatiently.
        
        “I was thinking — to fast means not to eat, right?” said Chotu.
        
        “Yes?” said the mother.
        
        The whole troop was now alert.
        
        “But we can hold a banana in our hand, can’t we?” asked Chotu.
        
        “What did you say?” Mother glared at Chotu.
        
        “No eating. Only holding the banana in our hand,” added Chotu hastily.
        
        The troop gravely considered this suggestion.
        
        “Is there any harm?” asked Chotu humbly.
        
        Mother looked at the wise old monkey. “A good suggestion must be considered, even if it comes from someone younger to us,” said the wise old monkey with a serious look.`,
        description3: `Holding the peeled off banana in their hands and with eyes closed, the monkeys sang songs in praise of the Lord.

        Then Chotu opened a corner of his eyes again. Banana! Peeled banana in hand!
        
        “No, Chotu, you can’t eat it,” the mother warned Chotu.
        
        “I was just thinking, only thinking…” said Chotu.
        
        All the monkeys were now alert. They were keen to know what new suggestion Chotu was about to give.
        
        “I was thinking, is there any harm in keeping the banana in our mouth?” asked Chotu hopefully.
        
        “Not eating,” assured Chotu, “Only keeping it in the mouth, instead of holding it in our hands.”
        
        “Hmmm… By keeping the banana in the mouth, you are not breaking the fast for sure,” said the wise old monkey.
        
        Without further discussion, all the monkeys popped the banana into their mouths.
        
        It was Chotu again who blurted out, “Mumma…”
        
        Mother monkey gave him a questioning look. She could not talk as she had the banana in her mouth.
        
        “Mother, I think… I think…”
        
        All the monkeys held their breath.
        
        “I think banana is gone. It is in my tummy.”
        
        All the monkeys gave Chotu an understanding look, running their hands on their tummies. There was silence. Then the wise old monkey spoke, “We have made a great discovery.” All monkeys looked at the wise old monkeys with great attention. The wise old monkey spoke slowly, weighing each word, “We have made a great discovery that you cannot keep a banana in the mouth for too long.”`

        description1: `The village at the foot of a hill was peaceful. People were honest and hard working. The Village Chief was a kind and just man.

        One morning, the villagers woke up to the sound of a bell. They knew it was not the familiar temple bell. This was different. It sounded scary. A child woken by the sound started crying. The mother hugged her child and said a prayer to ward off danger.
        
        They did not know who was ringing the bell. But they were certain that the sound was coming from the hills.
        
        An old man said that a demon had come to the hills. A cowherd said he saw huge footprints. “No man can leave such huge footprints,” he said. “It must be the footprint of a giant.”
        `,
        description2: `“Why does he ring the bell?” a small urchin asked. He was told to shut up.

        But one villager had a ready explanation. “I’ve heard of giants with huge bells hanging from their ears!”
        
        “As they walk, the bells swing making those clanging sounds,” explained a villager who was considered smart.
        
        Now the villagers had a picture of a giant or a group of giants with huge bells hanging from their ears. They called the giants Ghantakarnas — the Bell Demon.
        
        They stopped going to the hillside.
        
        Nagamma, who lived in a hut on the outskirts of the village, became curious. One morning, she left for the hills. Being cautious, she moved stealthily. Then, she heard the bell ringing. Scared, she climbed the nearest tree. From the tree top she could see far. She was surprised to see a pack of monkeys playing. They were playing with a huge bell!
        
        Nagamma surmised that the monkeys must have found the bell in the old temple atop the hill.`,
        description3: `She was back next day — this time with a basket full of bananas. Seeing her with bananas, the monkeys came after her. She dropped the basket and ran for cover. The monkey which was ringing the bell, dropped the bell to pick up a banana. The monkeys were busy eating the bananas. They hardly noticed Nagamma picking up the bell and moving away swiftly.

        Nagamma reached the village square and rang the bell. At first, the villagers were scared that the Bell Demon had entered the village. Then they realized it was Nagamma ringing the bell. They gathered around her. She told them how she drove away the Bell Demon and walked away with his bell.`
